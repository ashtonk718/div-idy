<div class="product-details">
    <ul>
        <li>SIZE: The set contains two Zak tumblers that are 3.16 inches in diameter and 6.67 inches tall. They have a capacity of 15 ounces.</li>
        <li>MATERIAL: The durable tumblers are made of plastic with silicone straws. Long-lasting and BPA free, they're dishwasher safe, can be disassembled for easy cleaning, and should not be microwaved.</li>
        <li>LEAK-PROOF DESIGN: The silicone straw has a built-in valve that allows liquid to flow when drinking and prevents accidental spills when the tumbler is tipped over. The straw is also soft and comfortable for kids to drink from.</li>
        <li>AT HOME OR ON THE GO: The straw tumbler is suited for travel, since it won't leak and fits in car cup holders while keeping drinks easily accessible. It's also great for drinking beverages at home without worrying about stains or nearby electronics.</li>
        <li>LIFESTYLE: Zak Designs drinkware makes hydration fun! These tumblers are a great gift for kids just graduating from sippy cups. The tumblers are fully reusable--no more disposable cups--and a fun addition to the daily routine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Div-idy's Recommendation</h3>
    <p>The toddler cups have received positive feedback for their leak-proof design, durability, and ease of cleaning. They are praised for being toddler-friendly with secure lids and colorful options. However, some drawbacks include potential design wear and tear, especially with hand washing, and minimal insulation due to the plastic material. Overall, these cups are a great choice for parents looking for practical and child-safe drinking solutions for their little ones.</p>
