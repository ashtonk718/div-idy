        <li>About this item</li>
        <li>10 plus YEARS OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS – Mr. Pink has been available on Amazon since 2012 and consistently gets the best ratings and reviews (40,000 plus and growing). It’s one of the best-selling products in the history of Chemical Guys. Don’t believe us. Check out the reviews and ratings on this page.</li>
        <li>FOAMY FUN – The key to a clean car or a complete detail starts with a great wash. The best way to wash your car, truck, SUV, RV or Jeep is to use a product that creates a lot of foam. Mr. Pink produces thick, dirt fighting bubbles that help clean any vehicle.</li>
        <li>BUCKET, FOAM GUN OR CANNON – Whether you are washing with a wash mitt and bucket, a foam gun connected to your garden hose, or a foam cannon connected to your pressure washer, Mr. Pink is the right car wash soap to deliver loads of foam and suds to get a great wash.</li>
        <li>MADE IN AMERICA – Each bottle of Mr. Pink is proudly produced in the USA. We celebrate the happiness of clean cars each day in our Southern California headquarters as well as our Detail Garage retail store locations throughout the country.</li>
        <li>CONCENTRATED – A little bit goes a long way. Just add 1-3 oz. of Mr. Pink to a 5 gallon wash bucket or to a 32 oz. solution tank for your foam cannon or foam gun and you are ready to experience a foam frenzy.</li>
        <li>SMELLS GREAT, LOOKS GREAT, FEELS GREAT – Washing your car should not only be fun, but it should make you feel good. It makes you feel awesome when your ride looks clean and new. We’ve created Mr. Pink to not only make your wash better and easier, but also, the amazing candy scent adds to your car washing experience.</li>
        <li>PH BALANCED – Other detailing shampoos and low grade car wash soaps are often too strong, stripping wax and staining plastic and rubber parts. Mr. Pink is pH balanced and gentle on all exterior automobile parts like paint, clear coat, polished metals, glass, and plastic trim. It's safe on waxes, sealants and ceramic coatings too.</li>
