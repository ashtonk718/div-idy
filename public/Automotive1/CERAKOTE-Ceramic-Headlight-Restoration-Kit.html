        <li><strong>About this item</strong></li> 
        <li>LASTS AS LONG AS YOU OWN YOUR VEHICLE! - Our chemists developed our Ceramic Coating Headlight Restoration kit IN HOUSE at Cerakote HQ. We aren't re-bottling another company's product. This is a CERAMIC coating for cars that chemically bonds to your headlights and provides UV protection for as long as you'll own your vehicle.</li> 
        <li>NO POWER TOOLS REQUIRED - Everything is included in the kit for your car. There are no tools required that could potentially damage your headlights or paint. There's nothing worse than having to call your crazy uncle you haven't seen since the holidays because he's got the power tools you need. After he hollers "STAND CLEAR!!", fires up his wheezing disk sander, runs it off of your headlight and across the paint on your hood.. It's too late. DON'T BUY A KIT THAT REQUIRES TOOLS!</li>
        <li>RESTORES AND PROTECTS FROM UV! - This isn't the classic bait-and-switch you're used to. We won't sell you something that needs to be purchased again in a few months. Our CERAMIC coating wipes provide a layer of UV protection that will last as long as you own your vehicle. We believe in providing our customers the best products on earth, the first time. After all, we're the chemists that have been providing world-class ceramic coatings to endless industries for DECADES. It's what we do.</li>
        <li>3 EASY STEPS! - Cerakote's Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit is a simple, 30 minute process. Step 1: You'll be mesmerized by our Oxidation Remover as you wipe away the hazy surface oxidation. Step 2: Use our ergonomic surface prep pad to remove the deep oxidation and prep your headlight for the CERAMIC clear coating. Step 3: Cerakote's pre-moistened Ceramic Headlight Restoration Wipes restore your headlights to a like-new condition that will last as long as you own your vehicle.</li>
        <li>WHY TRUST CERAKOTE? – Cerakote is regarded as the world’s leading innovator and manufacturer of true inorganic ceramic polymer technology. The ceramic polymers and coatings produced at Cerakote’s US facility are trusted by some of the most advanced aerospace, automotive and technology companies in the world. Rely on the industry leader to protect what matters to you.</li>
