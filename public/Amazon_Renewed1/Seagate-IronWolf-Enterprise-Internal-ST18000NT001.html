<div class="recommendation-propage">
    <h3>Div-idy's Recommendation</h3>
    <p>Based on the provided customer reviews, it seems that the refurbished drives generally perform well with most users experiencing drives in like-new condition with no issues. However, there is a risk involved as seen with one user who encountered a drive failure shortly after purchase. It's recommended to carefully consider the trade-off between cost savings and potential reliability issues when opting for renewed drives. If budget is a priority and you are willing to take the risk, these refurbished drives could be a good option for expanding your storage capacity. Ensure to backup critical data regularly to mitigate any unexpected failures.</p>
