<div class="recommendation-propage">
    <h3>Div-idy's Recommendation</h3>
    <p>Based on the customer reviews, the Apple Watch Series 4 has received mixed feedback. While it offers some great features like good touch screen responsiveness, nice design, and ease of connectivity, the common issue highlighted is the battery life. Users have reported that the battery drains quickly and may not last a full day without frequent recharging. Additionally, some units arrived with scratches, impacting the overall appearance.</p>
    <p>Considering the feedback, it's recommended to be cautious when purchasing this model, especially if battery life is a crucial factor for you. If you can overlook the battery issue, the Apple Watch Series 4 may still be a suitable choice for its other benefits.</p>
