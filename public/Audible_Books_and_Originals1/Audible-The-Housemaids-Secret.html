I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want.It’s almost perfect. But I still haven’t met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I’m sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I’m doing laundry. And one day I can’t help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes everything....  That’s when I make a promise. After all, I’ve done this before. I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe.Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It’s simply a question of how far I’m willing to go....Anyone who loves The Perfect Marriage by Jeneva Rose, The Woman in the Window, and Gone Girl will be totally hooked!
