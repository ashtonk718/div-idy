    <ul>
        <li>"A world-class whodunit."—Stephen King</li>
        <li>“An extremely successful high-wire act, balancing between dark comedy and darker thrills.”—Alex Michaelides, #1 New York Times bestselling author</li>
        <li>"Laugh-out-loud funny, thrilling and twisty..."—Liane Moriarty, #1 New York Times bestselling author</li>
        <li>"A lot of thrillers these days use the murder podcast as a plot device. This production simulates one better than any audiobook I’ve listened to, to an often hilarious effect. Also, January LaVoy expertly voices one of Lucy’s funniest tics: imagining how she would murder nearly every person with whom she comes in contact."—Vulture</li>
        <li>"Narrator January LaVoy is a treat to listen to, as she gives Lucy the sardonic tone she needs as she grapples with life. LaVoy is also a genius in the way she gives life to Lucy's inner voice—a psychological shoulder demon who wants to solve every issue with ... 'let's kill him.'"—The Berkshire Eagle</li>
        <li>"Narrator LaVoy absolutely shines as the broken yet charmingly cheeky heroine. Her tale is organically intermixed with podcast excerpts delivered in honeyed and wry tones by Will Damron, each bookended by delightful 'podcasty' melodies."—Booklist</li>
        <li>What if you thought you murdered your best friend? And if everyone else thought so too? And what if the truth doesn't matter?</li>
        <li>After Lucy is found wandering the streets, covered in her best friend Savvy’s blood, everyone thinks she is a murderer. Lucy and Savvy were the golden girls of their small Texas town: pretty, smart, and enviable. Lucy married a dream guy with a big ring and an even bigger new home. Savvy was the social butterfly loved by all, and if you believe the rumors, especially popular with the men in town. It’s been years since that horrible night, a night Lucy can’t remember anything about, and she has since moved to LA and started a new life.</li>
        <li>But now the phenomenally huge hit true crime podcast "Listen for the Lie," and its too-good looking host Ben Owens, have decided to investigate Savvy’s murder for the show’s second season. Lucy is forced to return to the place she vowed never to set foot in again to solve her friend’s murder, even if she is the one that did it.</li>
        <li>The truth is out there, if we just listen.</li>
        <li>A Macmillan Audio production from Celadon Books. Read more</li>
