The streamlined shape design and the weight control of each component make the freezer very easy to move. You can change the position of the freezer at any time according to changes in demand. Not only that, it will not take up too much space for you. You can determine whether the size of the freezer meets your needs before buying. SIZE: (precise): 20.1"L x 21.3"D x 31.4"H</li>
        <li>7-LEVEL THERMOSTAT SYSTEM - The temperature control device of the 3.0 cu.ft freezer is designed inside the freezer.
