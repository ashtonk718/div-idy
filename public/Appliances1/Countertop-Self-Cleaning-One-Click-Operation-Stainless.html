<div class="recommendation-propage">
    <h3>Div-idy's Recommendation</h3>
    <p>The ice maker offers several benefits such as producing a good amount of ice, being easy to use and clean, and its portability. However, it may require occasional maintenance like descaling and has limited ice storage capacity. Some users reported issues with machine durability over time. Overall, for the price, convenience, and quality of ice produced, the ice maker is recommended for those looking for a reliable and budget-friendly option for making ice at home.</p>
