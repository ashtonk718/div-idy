        <li>FAST ICE MAKER: The Silonn countertop ice maker only takes 6 minutes to make 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes. Fill the water into the water tank, maximum ice capacity can reach 26 pounds in 24 hours.</li>
        <li>TWO SIZES OF ICE CUBES: You can make two different sizes of ice cubes. Small ice cubes can chill seafood and beer keeping it fresh and cold. Large ice cubes are more suitable for beverages to achieve a rapid cooling effect.</li>
        <li>EASY CARRY DESIGN: Silonn ice maker machine is portable with size of 11 x 9 x 11 inches. Our ice maker also has a sturdy handle that makes carrying from room to room even place to place a breeze. Have ice anywhere, anytime.</li>
        <li>QUIET AND USER FRIENDLY: When making ice cubes, the noise is lower than 35dB, similar to a working refrigerator. The transparent lid allows you to monitor the ice capacity. The sensor automatically detects when ice is full and stops producing to prevent overflowing.</li>
        <li>EASY TO CONTROL: The control panel is very easy to operate. Fill the ice maker with water, press the ON button, select the size of the ice cubes and thatâ€™s it. When the water is insufficient or the ice basket is full, the indicator light will turn on.</li>
