    <ul>
        <li>FAST ICE MAKER: The Silonn ice maker only takes 6 minutes to make 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes. Fill 2L of water into the water tank, maximum ice capacity can reach 26 pounds in 24 hours.</li>
        <li>TWO SIZES OF ICE CUBES: You can make two different sizes of ice cubes. Small ice cubes can chill seafood and beer keeping it fresh and cold. Large ice cubes are more suitable for beverages to achieve a rapid cooling effect.</li>
        <li>QUIET AND USER FRIENDLY: When making ice cubes, the noise is lower than 35dB, similar to a working refrigerator. The transparent lid allows you to monitor the ice capacity. The sensor automatically detects when ice is full and stops producing to prevent overflowing.</li>
        <li>EASY TO CONTROL: The control panel is very easy to operate. Fill the ice maker with water, press the ON button, select the size of the ice cubes and that’s it. When the water is insufficient or the ice basket is full, the indicator light will turn on.</li>
        <li>SELF-CLEANING & PORTABLE: Simply press the ON/OFF button for 5 seconds to start the self-cleaning process. The machine will circulate the water that is poured into it. Silonn's ice maker is compact with dimensions of 12.3 x 8.7 x 12.5 inches.</li>

<div class="recommendation-propage">
    <h3>Div-idy's Recommendation</h3>
    <p>The ice maker offers fast ice production and multiple baskets full per hour, making it convenient for daily use. However, users should be aware that the ice melts quickly in drinks, and the machine is not refrigerated. It provides a good balance between speed and convenience for those who need regular ice. Overall, if you prioritize speed and ease of use over ice melt time, this ice maker can be a valuable addition to your kitchen.</p>
