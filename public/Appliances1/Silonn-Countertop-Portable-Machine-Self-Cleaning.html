<div class="recommendation-propage">
    <h3>Div-idy's Recommendation</h3>
    <p>The countertop ice maker offers fast ice production, portability, and ease of setup and maintenance. It is suitable for those needing a convenient ice-making solution in small spaces. However, users should be aware of the ice cubes melting quickly and the need for immediate transfer to the freezer to prevent clumping. Despite these limitations, the overall convenience and performance of the ice maker make it a practical choice for personal use or small gatherings. It's a valuable addition to any kitchen or entertaining space.</p>
