<div class="propage-details">
    <ul>
        <li>BEAUTIFUL LINCOLN PENNY COLLECTION - The set includes 12 Lincoln cents minted during World War II. A copper shortage in 1943 led the United States Government to issue a zinc-coated steel penny. Shell casings were used in 1944 through 1946, which produced a slight color change from the original Lincoln Wheat Cent. The 1943 penny is the only US penny that may be picked up with a magnet. All dates are readable on each coin. The patriotic theme continues with a bald eagle holding a red, white and blue shield.</li>
        <li>RARE SPECIMENS FOR COLLECTORS - These rare pieces are highly popular for beginning coin collectors, hobbyists, and people of all ages. This historic collection includes the 1943 steel penny as well as coins struck from shell casings off battlefields in 1944, '45, and '46. Issues from Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco mints are included, mounted with visible wheat backs. The set is housed in a 4 x 5-inch clear acrylic that is sonically sealed for protection.</li>
        <li>CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY - Includes a Certificate of Authenticity.</li>
        <li>GREAT GIFT - Comes packaged, perfect for the collector, your dad, husband, boyfriend, brother, sister, daughter, son, mother, father, or special someone. Great for birthdays, Christmas, Fatherâ€™s Day, special events, graduation, anniversaries, and retirements. Coins are a perfect gift as they detail time and spirit through their obverse and reverse designs, images, wording, and dates. Coins make fun keepsakes for travel, special events, and holidays. Coins are historical, educational, and collectible.</li>
        <li>OUR PROMISE - Includes a one-year warranty.</li>
