            Draw anywhere on the screen, any size you want to create legs and run. Draw specific legs for each obstacle you find in the obstacle course. Draw unique shapes for each challenge you face in the race. Each set of legs you draw should be able to handle the obstacles.
            If your legs don't run the obstacle course fast enough then your opponent will likely win the race and you will need to start all over again. So, be sure to draw the right set of legs for your runner to be the best climber in the obstacle course. If your climbing skills are weak, then you will fall down over and over again. All it takes is drawing a nice set of legs to make your character climb the best in the obstacle course.
            This is a fun running style arcade game that the whole family can enjoy. Watch your friends and family draw funny sets of legs and see if they actually handle the obstacle course well, or do the legs not allow them to climb very good? It's extremely fun to watch!
            There are an unlimited amount of levels, and challenged to draw legs for. Watch your runner tackle level after level as you get better and better at drawing legs to run and climb with.

            Be the best climber by drawing the legs that fit the environment the best.

If you draw bad climber legs, just draw quickly to fix your mistake and make the perfect set of climber legs for the obstacles that lay in your way. You will need to watch the other side of the road, because there is another character that is racing you to the finish line, and they will also try to draw the best climber legs. If you're having trouble drawing climber legs then you may want to copy what your opponent is doing when they draw their climber legs. Unless of course they're not doing too good on their race track, and you cannot even see them because your set of climber legs are much better than theirs. If you're winning the race with your climber legs then you're doing the best drawing job you can do. Once you cross the finish line with the legs you drew you will know you had the best set of climber legs for each obstacles because you are the Draw Climbing champion.
