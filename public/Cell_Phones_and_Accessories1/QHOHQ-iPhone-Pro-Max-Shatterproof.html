Certified to meet international military standards, it has been reinforced multiple times at 800Â°C, offering 9H+ hardness to prevent shattered edges, scratches, and breakage.

It fits perfectly with the phone screen, ensuring no gaps around the edges to prevent dust and dirt from entering. This design provides full protection for the screen and enhances the touch experience.</li>
        <li>Ultra-thin & High-definition Experience: Crafted with 0.33 mm ultra-thin tempered glass, the screen protector offers superfast app launching, maintaining the same response speed and touch experience as a bare phone. It also preserves original ultra-high-definition image quality. The surface is treated with a plasma oil-resistant coating to prevent fingerprints caused by sweat and oil stains, enhancing screen visibility and keeping it clean.</li>
        <li>Easy Installation: The QHOHQ-designed glass screen protector for iPhone 16 Pro Max includes a simple Installation Tool that aligns automatically with your phone's screen, leaving no bubbles or imperfections. Enjoy your screen as if there were no protector on it. Please watch our installation video tutorial before installation.</li>
        <li>AR Technology and Night Shooting Function: The specially designed camera lens protector for the iPhone 16 Pro Max incorporates the latest AR-enhanced "seamless" fusion technology to enhance light transmittance and improve photo and video quality.
